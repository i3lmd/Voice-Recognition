    and performs actions based on recognized keywords.

    Examples of commands:

    5. Ask the assistant's name: "what's your name"
    6. Ask who made the assistant: "who created you"
    7. Ask what the assistant can do: "what can you do"
    8. Get current time: "what time is it", "time"
    9. Get current date: "what's the date today", "date"
    10. Tell a joke: "tell me a joke", "joke"
    11. Define a term: "define quantum physics"
    12. Answer general knowledge (who/where): "who is Albert Einstein", "where is Germany"
    13. Basic math calculations: "calculate 5 plus 3", "what is 10 divided by 2"
    14. Exit the program: "exit", "quit", "stop"
